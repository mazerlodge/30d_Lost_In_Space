Day 1 
	- Intro to plugging Arduino into computer w/ USB 
	- Intro to Arduino Studio 
	- Arduino Blink example code
	- Code fn()s 
		-- pinMode(pin, input|output) 
		-- digitalWrite(pin, low|high) 
		-- delay(ms) 
	- Modify Blink to do 150ms delay between 3x blinks, then 1000ms delay before looping
	
	ToDo: 
		-- Do 3x blink example demonstrated
	
Day 2 
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IulLD1Q1ZM
		
	- Current = Voltage / Resistance 
	
	- Resistors tested w/ LEDs, all seem OK 
		2000 red blk red
		1000 brn blk red 
		0470 yel vio bwn
		0100 bwn blk brn  - seems a little too bright. 
		
		Course Instructions used a 220 ohm resistor.
 
 	- Code written to flash external LED 
 		
			
Day 3 
	- Switch inline in circuit 
		+5v --> switch --> pin2 w/ resist to gnd 
	
	- Switch on, blink light 3 times w/ 100ms delay b/n blinks and 1s delay b/n 3 blinks 

	- Elaboration on need for resistor between input voltage and pin sampling 	

	
Day 4 
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpsJpYL1XZA
	
	Also ref:
	https://inventr.io/lesson/day-4-cabin-lighting/
	
	Agenda:
	Initial prog will control 3 lights via 3 switches 	

	Notes: 
	Exercise done and customized to blink LEDs in a pattern 
	Broke one prong on a 3 pos DIP switch, glad I've got more than one. 
	
Day 5 
	Creative day 
	
Day 6 
	- https://inventr.io/lesson/day-6-time-to-fix-the-battery/
	
	Agenda: 
	Serial port output 
	Analog photo resistor sensor
		- Blink onboard LED with delay equal to photo resistor value (100ms - 700ms typical)

Day 7: We still need to keep an eye on this
	
	Ref:
	N-- Course link: https://inventr.io/lessons/day-7/
	
	Agenda: 
	Other data types 
		- int (already used, range about -32k to +32k, aka 2^15 w/ last bit as sign)
		- unsigned int (positive numbers greater than ~32k, aka 2^16 w/ no sign bit)
		- float 
		- double 
		- code functions 
	
	POA:
	X-- Download Code sample. 
	C-- Create BOM 
	X-- Watch video 
	X-- Implement 

Day 8: Adding some color to this dark place

	Ref: 
	N-- Course link: https://inventr.io/lessons/day-8/
	
	Agenda 
	- Wire up an RGB LED (long lead is ground)
	- Send various color patterns to the LED


Day 9: Combine Photosensor and RGB LED to sim battery charge w/ LED signaling charge level

	Ref: 
	N-- Course link: https://inventr.io/lessons/day-9/
	
	Agenda 
	- Wire up an RGB LED (long lead is ground)
	- Add photo sensor on A0 (analog input) 
	- Send output to LED changing color as charge increases 
	- Also send text output to serial monitor 
	
Day 10: Creative Day #2

	Agenda 
	- Made deluxe color cycling RGB LED 

Day 11: Starting your control panel

	Agenda 
	- Keypad direct to Arduino ports 2-9
