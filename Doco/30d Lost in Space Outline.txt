Day 1 
	- Intro to plugging Arduino into computer w/ USB 
	- Intro to Arduino Studio 
	- Arduino Blink example code
	- Code fn()s 
		-- pinMode(pin, input|output) 
		-- digitalWrite(pin, low|high) 
		-- delay(ms) 
	- Modify Blink to do 150ms delay between 3x blinks, then 1000ms delay before looping
	
	ToDo: 
		-- Do 3x blink example demonstrated
	
Day 2 
	- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IulLD1Q1ZM
		
	- Current = Voltage / Resistance 
	
	- Resistors tested w/ LEDs, all seem OK 
		2000 red blk red
		1000 brn blk red 
		0470 yel vio bwn
		0100 bwn blk brn  - seems a little too bright. 
		
		Course Instructions used a 220 ohm resistor.
 
 	- Code written to flash external LED 
 		
			
Day 3 
	- Switch inline in circuit 
		+5v --> switch --> pin2 w/ resist to gnd 
	
	- Switch on, blink light 3 times w/ 100ms delay b/n blinks and 1s delay b/n 3 blinks 

	- Elaboration on need for resistor between input voltage and pin sampling

	Agenda:
	Initial prog will control 3 lights via 3 switches 	



- ToDo: 
	-- Check draw.io for circuit diagram ability (if not what) 
	-- Inventr.io uses Fritzing for circuit diagrams
